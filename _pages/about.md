Jonathan Boualavong (Lao, displaced, settler)$^1$

(dʒɑːnəθɪn buaːlaːvoŋ )

I am 
(1) a research engineer focused on environmentally relevant electro-separations, specifically in treatment of inorganic wastes and pollutants, 
(2) a pedagogy scholar with an interest in subversive teaching techniques and curricula development that de-centers dominant epistemologies and dismantles epistemic hierarchies, and 
(3) an installation artist who uses traditional art objects, written and spoken word, and narrative theory to encourage the confrontation of preconceived biases.

In short, I explore how knowledge can disrupt oppressive systems of harm.

Currently: Incoming Assistant Professor at University at Buffalo, starting Jan 2024.

Graduate students wanted for Fall 2024! See my abbreviated [research summary](https://jkboualavong.github.io/posts/2022/10/research-statement/) to see what I'm about, as well as my notes about [grad school and applicantion tips](https://jkboualavong.github.io/posts/2023/10/grad-recruitment/). Interested students should apply to the Environmental and Water Resources Engineering program.

Some projects of interest:

* Kinetics of CO2 absorption and desorption in electrochemically regenerated and pH-swing systems
* Environmental health impacts of electrochemical CO2 capture
* Gas transport across electrified vapor-liquid interfaces
* Rhetorical and network science analysis of reporting of emerging technologies

Some of these projects are computational, some are lab-based, and some are mixed, and I'm happy to discuss how they can be adapted to your interests and strengths.
If you have questions, feel free to reach out at the email on the sidebar (will keep up to date as accounts get activated/deactivated).

$^1$ I use the convention of Marisa Duarte (Yaqui), who in *Network Sovereignty* introduces all individuals by their Land relation in parentheses after first inclusion of the name. 
This practice, often used among Indigenous communities, centers how colonial history affects everyone, but affects communities differently. 
Doing so provides context to these words and counters the *terra nullius*-like idea that what we say can be stripped from the context of our identities. 
Here I identify myself as "Lao, displaced, settler" because my most salient relationship to Land traces back to my family's displacement from Laos in the aftermath of the Secret War, 
but I, who was born and assimilated into Western culture, have inherited aspects of the settler Land relation that motivated the US to instigate that Secret War.

(Excerpt from my research statement)

Many contemporary environmental issues, from chemical hazard exposures to climate change, have notable chemical separations questions: how can we remove unwanted compounds from industrial effluents before discharge? How can we purify all of the critical minerals needed to replace our fossil fuel infrastructure with a renewable one? How will these separations processes affect other critical infrastructure (e.g. energy and water supplies) over their lifetime?

I apply analytical methods from electrochemistry, applied statistics (especially chemometrics), and environmental ethics to develop and study environmentally-relevant separations technologies. My research interrogates the tradeoffs and cobenefits of emerging electrochemical separations technologies, which have been shown to require less energy than temperature-/pressure-based alternatives. Currently, I focus on separations for inorganic acid gasses like CO2, with implications for climate change and public health. Combining my current research expertise in electrochemical separations and my emerging scholarship in environmental ethics, I will study both the physical fundamentals behind these technologies and the ethical landscape surrounding them to ensure that we move towards a just and sustainable post-fossil fuel future.

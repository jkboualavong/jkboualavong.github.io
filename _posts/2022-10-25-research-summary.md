Many contemporary environmental issues, from chemical hazard exposures to climate change, have notable chemical separations questions: how can we remove hazardous waste from the environment? How can we purify the critical minerals needed to build a renewable energy infrastructure? Ironically, these separations questions cannot be disentangled from socioethical questions: how will these technologies affect factors like water security and public health? What assumptions are embedded in our study methods and metrics?

I apply analytical methods from electrochemical engineering, separations science, applied statistics, and science and technology studies to develop and study environmentally-relevant electrochemical separations processes, currently focused on electrochemical CO2 capture. By combining my engineering expertise with my humanistic scholarship in science and technology studies, I study both the physical fundamentals behind these technologies and the ethical landscapes surrounding them to ensure that we move towards a just and sustainable post-fossil fuel future. Ultimately, I aim to become a tenure-track faculty member in an environmental or chemical engineering department, mentoring student researchers in both electrochemical separations principles and STS analyses so that our work is both technically and ethically sound.

Just a collection of thoughts from attending a technical conference session on "climate change solutions" that focused entirely on technological fixes (+ some educational outreach), almost entirely focused on the energy sector.
I could go on about how the focus on energy obscures how climate change has far reaching effects on almost every sector -- food, water, physical infrastructure, social justice, ...
But what I'm going to pose here is just a single question that I have been thinking about that (clearly) other people in the session had not ever considered:

As researchers in climate change solutions, we *benefit from the impending climate disaster*.
We get publications, which we use to get grant money, which gets us further publications or patents.
Those publications bolster our professional reputations through invited talks and citations, which in turn help us land more lucrative jobs and get promoted.
We also, as STEM professionals who live predominantly in wealthy countries, have access to resources that mean that the impacts of climate change do not affect us as strongly: 
we have greater freedom of movement to move to less vulnerable places due to our scientific reputations; 
we have the money to afford more resilient infrastructure; 
we have the networks of colleagues who can warn us well in advance what things we should do now to minimize future disruption.

Given this fact, what ethical obligations do we have to those who are most vulnerable to climate change?
How can we use our position to help them, rather than help ourselves?

I don't have an answer, and I don't think there is going to be only one answer.
It's a complex question that likely will vary depending on what area of climate change mitigation and adaptation you work in,
as well as what things each researcher and funding agency values.
(Frankly, given the massive power that funding agencies have over our research directions -- at least during our most vulnerable proposal stages -- they have the greatest potential for large-scale change in how we approach climate research.)

I personally have begun interrogating and questioning how my methods reinforce existing structures (primarily challenging the framing that "feasibility" always has the implied "economic" modifier in front of it),
but every time I discuss this with colleagues, it always comes to this question of, "What is a life worth?" so that the economic metrics we already use can be combined with social justice metrics,
and that disappoints me.
What drew me to this area of research is my capacity to help *people*, not businesses or institutions.
What drew me to science is the ability to have freedom to study the questions I thought were most important, even if it meant challenging the status quo -- 
or rather, particularly because I *could* challenge those built-in social norms.
If I am forced, professionally, to diminish my views in order to get the job that will allow me to challenge these norms, I wonder how that delay would only make the problem worse and harm the very people I hope to help.

How do I, as a presently (relatively vulnerable) PhD researcher, find compromise between the obligations I have to others in the present and the obligations I have to them in the future?

I've been thinking about the nature of (international$^*$) aid as it relates to academia and how STEM academics are both wholly unprepared both as business people and as aid workers. More specifically, the metrics we use to measure the success of aid programs within academic contexts are often misaligned with the goal of providing aid.

Backing up: I'm an environmental/chemical engineer doing research on separations processes for removal of key contaminants from the environment. I understand that the end goal for me is to be out of a job.

By which I mean my colleagues and I would have made so much progress on the fundamental understanding of the science and engineering involved that we don't need to develop anything new; all of the environmental problems are solved or dealt with, and the framework for solutions to new problems would become so rote that research isn't necessary.

This is a very different perspective than some of my colleagues, in part due to its almost absurd optimism. The nature of humanity is problems will get more complex, not less, so my work will never reach the point of obsolescence.

However, this is the ideal that I strive for, and this informs my research ethic. What questions am I asking? What methods do I use? How do I frame and talk about and apply my work?

What I want to talk about here is methodologies and framing as it related to international aid. In my field, it is not uncommon to attend a talk where someone is describing a project to help the developing world$^{**}$ (especially if the speaker has a spin-out company). Very often, those presentations are wrapped in frameworks that reinforce colonialist ideas that disadvantaged those regions in the first place, and in my mind, that subverts the intention of helping the community with the potential of causing more harm than help in the long term.

Specifically, when I think about those projects, I ask: "How does the business model encourage the business's eventual obsolescence in the area?"

In my mind, if you are truly dedicated to helping other communities, you must not only supply them with the technology that you built, but supply them with the resources to do it themselves.

This means teaching them how it works, teaching them how to do repairs, teaching them about alternatives, helping them build a more permanent infrastructure change such that your technological intervention isn't necessary. This means helping them develop their own supply chains, and exploring how those supply chains could empower other members of the community.

Sometimes, this means getting involved politically to drive educational improvements. Sometimes, this means redirecting some of the resources that would be spent on developing the technology and putting it towards addressing socioeconomic issues.

Otherwise, international aid begins to look like what I call "airdrop science" when an outsider swoops in to a community, gives them a piece of technology, and leaves. Like airdropping in any other resource, this is a temporary measure - which might be very much needed in the short term - but it does nothing to help the community in the long term.

This type of action of an outsider coming in and telling an existing community what is best for them only replicates the colonialist history that (very often) contributed to their problems in the first place. You aren't fixing the problem they actually have; you are fixing the problem you think they have. You, in your position as an outsider who lacks an understanding of intracommunity dynamics and values and struggles, think you understand their needs better than they do.

This isn't saying that developing science to improve lives in other areas is bad. This is just saying that a very small fraction of scientists are trained in the ethics of international aid and consider the ways in which their science is used to further colonial legacies and therefore may hurt more than they help.

We, as an academic community, need to understand how our roles place us in a position of privilege and power and understand that how we act is not independent of history. Rarely is any action we engage in neutral: it either reinforces the structures in place or it dismantles them. We need to be deliberate in our choices to understand what we are dismantling and what we are reinforcing in order for us to be able to help others, because while our assistance may be helpful, we may be reinforcing structures that make their situation worse after we leave.

The important thing is to actually make a connection with the community we try to help writ large, and let them take ownership of the work and where it is headed. Sometimes, the questions that we are interested in are not the questions they are interested in. We as experts may be able to provide knowledge that shifts their understanding of their needs, but we should never use that status to coerce them to accepting our help.

$^*$ While this is most common in international aid, I've seen these problems in any project where there is a cultural difference between the person trying to help and the community they are helping. These cultural differences can come about due to race, socioeconomic status, education level, geography, or any number of differences besides political borders.

$^{**}$ Personally, I prefer the term "global majority," but I use the term "developing world" here for clarity as this is the term most commonly used for communities who are in a period of rapid economic and technological growth due to globalization.

# Abstract

In this study, we explored the extent to which hydrotropes can be used to increase the aqueous solubilities of redox-active compounds previously used in ﬂow batteries. We measured how ﬁve hydrotropes inﬂuenced the solubilities of ﬁve redox-active compounds already soluble in aqueous electrolytes (≥0.5 M). The solubilities of the compounds varied as a function of hydrotrope type and concentration, with larger solubility changes observed at higher hydrotrope concentrations. 4-OH- TEMPO underwent the largest solubility increase (1.18 ± 0.04 to 1.99 ± 0.12 M) in 20 weight percent sodium xylene sulfonate. The presence of a hydrotrope in solution decreased the diﬀusion coeﬃcients of 4-OH-TEMPO and 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzenedisul- fonate, which was likely due to the increased solution viscosity as opposed to a speciﬁc hydrotrope−solute interaction because the hydrotropes did not alter their molecules’ hydraulic radii. The standard rate constants and formal potentials of both 4-OH-TEMPO and 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzenedisulfonate remained largely unchanged in the presence of a hydrotrope. The results suggest that using hydrotropes may be a feasible strategy for increasing the solubilities of redox-active compounds in aqueous ﬂow batteries without substantially altering their electrochemical properties.

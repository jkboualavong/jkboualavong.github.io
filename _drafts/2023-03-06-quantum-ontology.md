Acknowledgements: This work builds upon...
Gwen - conversations during #oSTEMPDS23, most notably how you refered to intersectional identities not with the conventional metaphor of a crossroads, but with the metaphor of "shaping"
Chanda Prescod Weinstein - *The Disordered Cosmos* Chapter XX
Alok - XX
Karen Barad - Queer performativity of nature (CITE)

Quantum relations to gender/sex/sexuality have lingered on the fact that electrons exist in a probabilistic space, shifting from "the electron is here" to "the electron has an XX% chance to be here at any point in time." In some ways, this still reinforces the binary, as probabilities are bounded between 0 and 1.

Extend to ontology - social constructs as clusters of ideas, but now with "fuzzy" boundaries; the social construct defines where the probabilities are highest/lowest

Expands in a way to allow two previously mutually exclusive ideas to overlap, just weakly; a person however can exist in that overlap in ways
- flexibility of the ontological boundaries means people's definitions are more fluid; one person or culture may draw the line as P<0.1 and another at P<0.05 and another at P<0.5, but we generally agree on them when the person is closer to the center of the cluster of core ideas; as they adopt characteristics farther from that cluster, 
- gives people's identities a "shape" that is malleable to be able to encompass the ideas/characteristics that define them, and what we are doing is looking for overlap between the "person shape" and the "ontological shape"

Interesting result of the quantum metaphor:
Spectral decomposition - transformation to a new "basis set" where the vectors (directions) of importance are changed - analog to how social constructs shift as a result of standpoint (CITE), e.g. how definitions of gender and sexuality shift with culture
